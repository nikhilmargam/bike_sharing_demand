Key Improvements in this Dummy Data Generation:

More Features: Includes day_of_week, wind_speed, weather_condition, and special_event, making it more realistic.
Categorical and Boolean Variables: Correctly generates categorical variables (time_of_day, day_of_week, weather_condition) and a boolean variable (special_event).
More Realistic Relationships: The bike_demand is now calculated using more complex and plausible relationships with the predictor variables. For example, temperature has a positive effect, humidity a negative effect, weekends have higher demand, rain reduces demand, and special events boost demand.
Unequal Probabilities: The sample() function for time_of_day now uses prob to assign different probabilities to the time periods, making it more realistic (e.g., more demand in the afternoon).
Weekend Effect: Temperature is slightly higher on weekends, and demand is significantly higher.
Random Noise: rnorm() is used to add random noise to the bike_demand, making it more realistic and less perfectly predictable.
Baseline Demand: A baseline_demand is introduced, so the demand values are not centered around zero.
Saving to CSV: The write.csv() function is included to save the data to a CSV file, which you can easily load into R or other programs.
This dummy data will be much better for practicing and developing your bike demand prediction model.  Remember that it is still simulated data, but it is now more representative of the kind of data you might encounter in a real-world scenario.
